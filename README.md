# Chaos Mod 3 for SCP: Secret Laboratory

## Description
Chaos Mod 3 is a plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory inspired by GTA SA/V Chaos Mod. Every minute it adds a new modifier to the game, and removes previous one making it more fun for people looking for something new.
This is a 3rd iteration of this project - the first one was killed by Exiled, as their API changed so much that is was easier to start over. The second version was also killed by Exiled - the same way, but this time I didn't even had a chance to publish it on GitHub.
This version uses officaial plugin API, and I hope this one does not change as much as Exiled did.



## List of modifiers
I advise to not check the list, and checkout the modifiers in the game instead.
<details>
    <summary>Spoilers ahead!</summary>

- Who needs keycards anyway? - You don't need a keycard
- Fuck 079 in particular - Unlocks and activates all generators for 60 seconds
- Hitman - Everyone gets a COM-15 with 12 ammo
- I am speed - Gives the effect of one SCP-207
- Infinite power - Tesla Gates winds up quicker
- 94 in 6 - 1 HP and no AHP to everyone besides SCPs
